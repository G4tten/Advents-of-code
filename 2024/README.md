This is my first year participating in the advents of code, sorry if my solutions are not optimal, with time I will improve 😉

This year I am in my second year of university and I am studying Python, so I will propose solutions with this language; however, since I also did c++ last year I do not exclude the possibility of adding a c++ solution in the future

Enjoy! 🫶🏻
